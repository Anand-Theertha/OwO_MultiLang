# OwO MultiLang
OwO, but this time in Different Languages!

Basically, for every programming language, create a file that prints "Hello World", then do it in a different language - For example, French, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Whatever!

And you can do it in and programming language you want, C#, JS, Java, C, ASM. Just because it's been done in C#/Spanish doesn't mean you can't do JS/Spanish or C#/English.

Structure as 

/Progamming Language/Written Language/Source File

In the readme, below this, Add compile instructions for the programming language if it doesn't yet exist.

### Python compilation instructions
